# Formula Sheets

These are formula sheets from my exams. They are missing some formulas (e.g. Conservation of Mechanical Energy) because I either memorized them or didn't need them for the exam.

> Note: the string example in [the reference](/Physics-1_Reference/Physics-1_Reference.pdf) is different than the ones in the [formula sheets](/Physics-1_Reference/Formula_Sheets/). The one in the reference is the correct one.
